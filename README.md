CIGA Core integration/staging repository
=====================================

CIGA is an open source crypto-currency focused on fast private transactions with low transaction fees & environmental footprint.  It utilizes a custom Proof of Stake protocol for securing its network and uses an innovative variable seesaw reward mechanism that dynamically balances 90% of its block reward size between masternodes and staking nodes and 10% dedicated for budget proposals. The goal of CIGA is to achieve a decentralized sustainable crypto currency with near instant full-time private transactions, fair governance and community intelligence.
Features:
- Anonymized transactions using the [_Zerocoin Protocol_](http://www.cigacoin.net/).
- Fast transactions featuring guaranteed zero confirmation transactions, we call it _SwiftX_.
- Decentralized blockchain voting utilizing Masternode technology to form a DAO. The blockchain will distribute monthly treasury funds based on successful proposals submitted by the community and voted on by the DAO.
